## Introduction

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a well-recognized group of techniques that has been used in psychotherapy, addictions, weight control, physical activity promotion, sexual health, clinical conditions treatment, medication adherence, public health and beyond (Lundahl and Burke, 2009; Anstiss 2009; Hardcastle et al, 2013). <!-- start with a bang. rather than only starting with a definition, define while giving some information on why this technique is absolutely essential to healthcare professionals  --> It has been increasingly studied in the last three decades and has showed significant evidence of efficacy in helping patients to change unhealthy behaviors (Lundahl and Burke, 2009). Adopting new habits is extremely important to reduce current morbi-mortality (Rollnick et al., 2008; Anstiss 2009) and there is an increasing interest to apply MI in different clinical settings (Rollnick et al., 2008; Soderlund et al, 2011). According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just four modifiable behavior risk factors (smoking, lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol use and unhealthy diet) can cause up to 40% of all the deaths in the US (Anstiss, 2009). MI interventions have low cost, virtually no side effects and a great cost-effectiveness (Rollnick et al., 2008; Lundahl and Burke, 2009). In the last 15 years, renowned institutions such as The World Health Organization – WHO -, The American Psychiatric Association – APA -and The American Heart Association, have recommend MI as an effective approach to promote health-related outcomes (WHO, 2001; APA, 2006; Hardcastle, 2013).

Although MI has a substantial amount of evidence to support its daily clinical use, MI is not so popular and known among healthcare professionals. (Lundahl and Burke, 2009). This can be partly explained by the fact that MI techniques are sometimes not natural or intuitive for the human been without training in this field. There are important efforts to introduce MI in health care in general (Soderlund et al, 2011).  In this context, different methods and ways of teaching have being tested which vary from formal lectures and workshops to use of technology such as avatar and virtual reality (Soderlund et al, 2011, Shershneva et al., 2014). However, there is no standard instrument to measure the knowledge of healthcare professionals in MI thus there are difficulties in evaluating how much the interventions improve subjects’ familiarity with this theme.

Lately, there were some initiatives to establish scales that could measure performance in MI. In 2003, Miller et al. developed the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC), a detailed and relatively laborious instrument that assesses the interaction between the health professional and the patient, especially useful in a research scenario (Moyers et al, 2010). Three other scales, the Behaviour Change Counselling Index (BECCI) – Lane et al., 2005 -, the Motivational Interviewing Supervision and Training Scale (MISTS) – Madson et al., 2005 - and the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) code – Moyers et al., 2010 - focus only in the practitioner behavior and mainly aim to provide structured feedback to improve practice in non-research settings (Rollnick et al., 2002 ;Moyers et al, 2010) MITI is more recent, shorter and more handful to apply than the others (Moyers et al., 2010). However, these instruments show some limitations and this is one reason why the development of MI assessment tools easier to apply has been discussed among MI researchers (Soderlund et al, 2011). The first restriction is that any of these scales are self-assessment instruments <!-- not sure self-assessment is the right term here as it means something else  --> so there is a need for a skilled observer what hinders the application. In addition to this, any of them approaches specifically knowledge in MI but only performance so it is not possible to accurately evaluate the relationship between teaching techniques and knowledge improvement, nor how knowledge affects clinical use of MI.

<!-- needs a brief paragraph on item banks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_bank and why they are better than individual scales -->

The objective of this study was to develop an item bank containing self-assessment items to evaluate the level of MI knowledge among healthcare professionals, validated through Item Response Theory models, which is considered the modern theory of psychometry and allows the comparison of scores on evaluations when using different items applied to the same group of individuals (Gomes et al, 2014). This is particularly important when assessing longitudinally knowledge since the use of classic scales could lead to recall bias.

## Methods

### Ethics committee

This preparatory study was part of a randomized controlled trial that compares new techniques of teaching MI (experimental group) and the traditional ways of learning (control group) carried out in 5 Brazilian cities between October, 2013 and December, 2013. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ingá University, informed consent being obtained from all the subjects prior to initiation of the study. 

### Participants

The knowledge scale development and validation study involved 400 healthcare professionals in the following Brazilian cities: São Paulo (n), Curitiba (n), Maringá (n), Maceió (n) and Ribeirão Preto (n), which are located in different regions of Brazil. Eligibility criteria included subjects who have contact with patients in the health care system with at least a high school level of education. Participants were technicians, university students, graduated professionals and post-graduated professionals in the areas of Medicine, Psychology, Nursing, Oral health, Nutrition, Physiotherapy and Physical Education. Prior to the study, the sample size was estimated around 350 to 450 (?) subjects (α = 0.05, power = 0.90, ?). Recruitment used a convenience sample of subjects of the target population (health care members). Each participant answered a set of 30 “true or false” self-administered knowledge questions. along with socio-demographic data: age, gender, educational background and area of work. 



### Item (question) development 

A group of 100 “true or false” questions (items) was established by 2 psychiatrists specialists in Motivational Interviewing. To ensure the clinical importance of the items, a research was performed in Google Schoolar in August, 2014, using the expression “Motivational Interviewing” and, then, the results with more than 10 years of publication were excluded to avoid potentially outdated material. Then, the specialists developed 100 items that approached the major and most repeated topics in the 10 most cited articles and the 3 most cited books. The latter are Motivational interviewing in health care: helping patients change behavior.(Rollnick et al., 2008); Motivational interviewing in the treatment of psychological problems (Arkowitz et al., 2007) and Motivational interviewing: Helping people change (Miller and Rollnick, 2012).  

### Qualitative validation

<!-- might want to expand this into an Agile protocol - item writing guidelines, write the item, qualitative interviews and modify items, qualitative validation, improve item writing guidelines, develop AIG   -->

As a way to facilitate and improve the statistical analysis (full section below), an initial set of 30 items was created using the criteria of different levels of difficulty. Were chosen 10 “easy” questions, 10 “intermediate” questions and 10 “difficult” questions according to the opinion of the specialists and 25 healthcare professionals that were evaluated in a pilot study. This test sample also gave feedback to ensure the proper comprehension of the items.


###  Data collection



### Item Response Modeling

The initial set of 30 items was exposed to 120 participants in our study leading to 10 anchoring items that were chosen according to the better discrimination power measured by differential item functioning (DIF). Then, an anchoring approach was used for linked scales where each set of 30 questions contained a constant group of 10 items that was repeated in every set and 20 random items, thus ensuring that all sets were connected. Subsequently, a sequence of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and validity triangulating across different items was used to achieve a psychometrically valid overall score. Full-information factor analysis was performed to test the unidimensionality of the knowledge scale since to be combined into a single scale the questions must have only one underlying trace.

The marginal maximum likelihood was used to calculated the probabilities of all different response patterns that possibly could occur. Differences in parameters were analyzed by chi-squared test using the significance level of 0.05.
